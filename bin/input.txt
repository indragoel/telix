Ricketts Glen State Park is a Pennsylvania state park and American 
 Natural Landmark on 13,050 acres (5,280 ha) in Columbia, Luzerne, 
 and Sullivan counties. The park has 24 named waterfalls along Kitchen
  Creek, as it flows down the Allegheny Front escarpment over four rock 
  formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The earliest 
  recorded inhabitants of the larger watershed were the Susquehannocks.
   The park is named for R. Bruce Ricketts, who built the trail along 
   the waterfalls and operated a hotel there from 1873 to 1903. Ricketts
    made his fortune clearcutting much of what is now the park, but preserved 
    about 2,000 acres (810 ha) of old-growth forest in its three glens. The park
     opened in 1944. The Benton Air Force Station, a Cold War radar installation
      in the park, operated from 1951 to 1975 and still serves as airport radar 
      for nearby Wilkes-Barre and as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. The park is
       home to a wide variety of plants and animals and 
was named an Important Bird A
